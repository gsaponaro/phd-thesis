\chapter{Acknowledgments}

First of all, I would like to give a warm thank you to my main supervisor, Prof.~Alexandre~Bernardino, for his constant guidance during the years that led to the preparation of this work, and for encouraging me to gain my independence. My co-supervisors, Prof.~Giampiero~Salvi and Prof.~Lorenzo~Jamone, have also supported me countless times with scientific insights, challenges, and suggestions, for which I am grateful.

I extend my gratitude to Prof.~José~Santos-Victor, director of the Computer and Robot Vision Laboratory~(VisLab) in Lisbon, for making me feel welcome, for making me feel an important ``player'' in a research team, and for creating an environment where it is possible to conduct research without worries. Thank you to all my laboratory mates as well~(too many to list!).

This research has been made possible with funding from the Portuguese Government (Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, doctoral grant SFRH/BD/61910/2009, project grants PEst-OE/EEI/LA0009/\allowbreak2011 and UID/EEA/50009/2013) and from the European Commission (POETICON++ project, FP7-ICT-288382).

The picture on the thesis cover was elaborated by me, modifying two open-access clipart images available from~\url{https://openclipart.org}, respectively drawn by Sirrob01~(robot image) and by an anonymous user~(boy image).

And finally, a heartfelt thanks to Cláudia for her unconditional patience and support all along.
